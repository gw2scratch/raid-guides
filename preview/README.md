# Raid Guide Preview
This is a simple Vue.js project which includes the guides and nothing else.

It does not run the full webpage, but allows editing and previewing guides contained in this repository
and provides the same libraries as the full webpage.

No code from this directory will be used on the live webpage,
all guide content should be located in the repository root.

## IDE usage

If you use an IDE to edit the guides, you likely want to open the root directory of the repository as a project to
easily access the contents, this directory only contains the simple wrapper used to run it.

yarn install
```
